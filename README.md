# k-04 sew-on hinging tools

Tools to help making sew-on control surfaces.

Sew on control surfaces are precise, have large range of movement, move freely, and are replacable. O, and lightweight.

You can cut your own tools with included svg file. The printed parts contain basic instructions for reference

There are 2 types of tools.
 - one "L" shaped which serves only to punch the holes. It is more precise and can be set at an angle so the needle will
	go perpendicular to the chord, not just the surface. This has patterns for 10x10, 20x20, 30x30, 40x40 and 50x50 patterns.
	You put the "L" over the trailing edge, and adjust the angle. Fix it with masking tape, or just make the first
	hole and leave the pin there. Now go along the chosen patterns line and pinch the holes. Make the same on the 
	control surface, making sure the holes align. Now you can sew as you would do normally but have the holes
	precsely pinched, which will result in a nice seam.
 - two plain plates, which help sewing directly without pinching the holes beforehand. Ideal for flat surfaces (ie flat table tails).
	Lay and align the tool directly over the small gap between trailing edge and control surface.
	Fix it with some masking tape (or pins if you don't mind the extra pinholes).
	Now you can sew directly over it, starting from its "right" and proceeding to the "left".
	You go up with the thread in an ovel opening, then go down in the next proper hole, opposite side than previous "up".
	Pull on the thread and let it sink into the diagonal cutting.

Suggested material: 3mm plywood or 2mm plastic for the 2nd type
